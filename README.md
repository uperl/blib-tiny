Like blib but lighter

# SYNOPSIS

```
perl -Mblib::tiny script [args...]
```

# DESCRIPTION

This works similar to [blib](https://metacpan.org/pod/blib), except it doesn't pull in any other
modules.  This avoids introducing side effects of loading modules
earlier or loading them at all compared to when they would be called
without [blib](https://metacpan.org/pod/blib).

It is different in that it does not die if there is no blib found,
and doesn't accept any arguments (only the blib relative to the current
directory is supported).

# CAVEATS

This module avoids using any other modules (in-core or otherwise) so as
not to pollute the namespace for tests or command lines, so it doesn't
even try to use native directory specifications with [File::Spec](https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Spec) etc,
and may not work on platforms other than Windows and Unix.
